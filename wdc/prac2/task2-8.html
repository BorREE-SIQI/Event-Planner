    <h1 class = "raleway">This new heading font is much more elegant</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    we've updated the font for headings to a more elegant one from Google Fonts: Raleway.
    <br>
    Note that for this to not break previous pages, san-serif should still be present as a fallback.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "raleway">L2 Heading font is also Raleway</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    Similarly, the default font is now Noto Serif from Google Fonts.
    <br>
    Again, for this to not break previous pages, serif should still be present as a fall back.
