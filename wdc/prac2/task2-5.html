    <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
    <p>
    This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
    <br>
    This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
    <hr>
    This is a normal paragraph, except <span>
