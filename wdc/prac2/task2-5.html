    <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
    <p>
    This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
    <br>
    This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
    <hr>
    This is a normal paragraph, except <span class = "blue">this span of text is blue</span>
    <span class = "fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span>because they belongs to two classes
    called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, <span class = "blue fancy">this span. of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
    </p>
    </div>
This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
